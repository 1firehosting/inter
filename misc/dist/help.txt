1. Installing font files

  Inter fonts comes in two flavors:
  Variable (Inter Variable*.ttf) and Static (Inter.ttc).

  Variable fonts allow you to choose any weight and optical size in
  supported software. Variable fonts is a relatively recent new
  technology, with varying degrees of software support.
  Inter's variable font is called "Inter Variable" to avoid
  confusion and to allow use alongside the traditional static fonts.

  Static fonts works with older software and uses a fixed set of
  predefined mixtures of weight and optical size. For example
  "Inter Display Medium" is Inter with maximum optical size and a
  weight of 500.

  You will be installing both of these flavors.


1.1. Installing on Apple macOS

  1. Open the "Font Book" application.
  2. In the main menu, select "File" â†’ "Add Fonts..."
  3. Select "Inter.ttc", "Inter Variable.ttf" and
     "Inter Variable Italic.ttf", then press "Open"

  Alternatively, if you prefer not to use Font Book, you can move or
  copy the font files directly into ~/Library/Fonts/


1.2. Installing on Microsoft Windows

  1. Open the zip file you downloaded
  2. Select the files "Inter TrueType.ttc", "Inter Variable.ttf" and
     "Inter Variable Italic.ttf"
  3. Right-click the selected files, choose "Install for all users"

  If you have a previous installation of Inter, you should make sure
  to remove those fonts files before installing new ones. You need to
  install the font for all users, as some software requires fonts to
  be global.


1.3. Installing on Ubuntu Linux

  1. Create a ".fonts" directory in your home. (mkdir -p ~/.fonts)
  2. Copy "Inter.ttc", "Inter Variable.ttf" and
     "Inter Variable Italic.ttf" into your .fonts directory
     (cp Inter.ttc *.ttf ~/.fonts/)

  If you prefer the look of Microsoft ClearType-style "hinted" fonts,
  for step 2, install "Inter TrueType.ttc" (INSTEAD OF "Inter.ttc".)

  You may have to restart apps and/or your window server session.

2. Using Inter in Web content

  1. Copy all woff2 files and the inter.css file from the "Web"
     directory to your web server

  2. Add the following into your HTML <head>:

       <link rel="preconnect" href="https://your-domain/">
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://your-domain/inter.css">

     Replace "your-domain" with the actual domain name where you host
     the woff2 font files.

  3. If you are using a CDN, disable any automatic compression for
     the woff2 files (they are already compressed) and set the
     following HTTP headers for the woff2 files:

       Content-Type: font/woff2
       Cache-Control: max-age=31536000

     The CSS contains specific version information in the URLs used
     to load the fonts, so this is safe for upgrading to newer
     versions of Inter.

  4. In your main document's CSS, add the following to use Inter:

       :root { font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; }
       @supports (font-variation-settings: normal) {
         :root { font-family: 'Inter var', sans-serif; }
       }

  There are many other ways of using Inter on the Web platform.
  The instructions above is simply one way.

  If you prefer to not host the fonts yourself, you can use the
  official Inter CDN, which as a bonus means you are always serving
  the latest version of Inter to your users:

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://rsms.me/">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css">

3. Hinted TrueType fonts (Inter TrueType.ttc)

  This distribution contains TrueType fonts with hints (the programs
  needed by ClearType) in a separate font bundle "Inter TrueType.ttc"

  Microsoft Windows uses a technology called ClearType which alters
  the shape of letters to increase sharpness, in particular for low-
  density displays. This requires a font to have little programs
  built into them, called TrueType hinting instructions, which lets
  ClearType knows how to alter each character.
  The standard distribution of Inter doesn't contain such "hints"
  since it is relatively rare (and the web fonts would grow much
  larger if they did contain such hinting programs.)
  Additionally, some people on Windows do not like the appearance of
  ClearType and prefer non-hinted fonts. (Tip: You can customize
  ClearType to your liking in Window's settings.)

  The variable font is currently not available with TrueType hints,
  only the traditional "static" font files are. This will hopefully
  change in a future release.

  Important: DO NOT INSTALL BOTH VERSIONS!

    DO NOT install both "Inter.ttc" and "Inter TrueType.ttc".
    DO install ONE OF those font files,
    or else confusing, strange things might happen (conflicts.)

  Recap:
  - If you want to make use of ClearType, install "Inter TrueType.ttc"
  - If you do not want or need ClearType support, install "Inter.ttc"
